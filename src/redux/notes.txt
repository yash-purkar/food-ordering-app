1st create store add reducers in that
create slice for menus in that use extraReducers for handling async operations
create async thunk to fetch api,
give name to that. in 1st argument and do what you want in the 2nd parameter which is callback.

and if you want to use this data you have to dispatch the action

in component

dispatch(asyncThunkName());
now it will fetch the data.
